Web Scripts


Web Scripts allow you to bind new Alfresco based functionality to a HTTP method and custom URL. A library of URLs may be built up to provide a complete API accessible via HTTP.  They are ideal for building data access & update APIs and simple UI components such as Portlets.  Development of Web Scripts may be performed within Alfresco.  Knowledge of Java is not required.



For example, you could create the following API for your particular application... 

Execute a search 

GET http://<host>:<port>/alfresco/service/blog/category/{category}

Retrieve meta-data for an item in the repository  

GET http://<host>:<port>/alfresco/service/blog/2007/03/04/new-release
 
Update meta-data for an item in the repository  

POST http://<host>:<port>/alfresco/service/blog/2007/03/04/new-release?status=Draft

Delete an item in the repository 

DELETE http://<host>:<port>/alfresco/service/blog/2007/03/04/new-release
